- **Next JS:** I have used Next.js that is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I have used TailwindCSS to style the different components.

- **API:** I have used the [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3) API to get all the information about teams, leagues and players.
